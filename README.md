# GruntTemplate


#### Working with an existing Grunt project

Assuming that the Grunt CLI has been installed and that the project has already been configured with a package.json and a Gruntfile, it's very easy to start working with Grunt:  
+ Change to the project's root directory.
+ Install project dependencies with `npm install`.  
+ Run Grunt with `grunt`.  

That's really all there is to it. Installed Grunt tasks can be listed by running `grunt --help` but it's usually a good idea to start with the project's documentation.
